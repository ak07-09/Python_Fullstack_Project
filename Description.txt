PROJECT TITLE: PROMPT BUILDER

DESCRIPTION:The Prompt Builder API is a Python-based project that generates and improves text prompts using simple rule-based logic. It allows users to input minimal text (like "gaming wallpaper"), and the system expands it into a detailed, well-structured prompt (e.g., "gaming wallpaper with futuristic RGB lights, neon, highly detailed, 8K resolution").

This project is built using FastAPI for creating RESTful endpoints and Supabase as the backend database to store both the original and improved prompts.

The goal of the project is to demonstrate how Python modules, data structures, and API frameworks can be combined to create a useful, beginner-friendly tool for prompt generation and management.
